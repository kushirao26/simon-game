# simon game
 The Simon Game is a classic memory-based electronic game where players are challenged to recall and reproduce increasingly complex sequences of lights and sounds. The game consists of four colored buttonsâ€”each producing a distinct tone when pressed.  At the beginning of the game, Simon randomly lights up one of the buttons and plays its corresponding sound. The player must then press the same button. In the next round, Simon adds another button to the sequence, and the player must reproduce the full sequence in order. This process continues, with the sequence growing longer each round.  If the player presses the wrong button, the game ends, and they must restart from the beginning. The goal is to remember and repeat the longest sequence possible without making a mistake.
